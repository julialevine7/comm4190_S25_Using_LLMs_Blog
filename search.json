    "text": "What tone and directive advice does it give when asking about minor injuries for dogs compared to humans?\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-02-05 at 2.34.18 PM.png\n\n\nFirst, when asking about medical advice for a minor injury related to the self (human), gpt-4o is quick to appeal to the person’s emotions, then moving to a list of care advice. This list includes injury assessment and various external and internal care actions that are home-based, including long-term care like taping and footwear adjustment. It then closes out with seeking further medical evaluation after a few days of constant pain.\n\n\n\nScreenshot 2025-02-05 at 2.38.40 PM.png\n\n\nComparatively, when asking for the same medical advice, but this time for a dog, gpt-4o takes a less face-to-face approach, instead apologizing for the incident rather than appealing to the dog. The care is also directed towards the human’s behavior and demeanor, rather than calming the dog down. The medical care for the dog also seems a bit less informed and therefore more severe, such as cleaning the area and monitoring for infection, which the human advice does not really account for. Additionally, included in the list of care is visiting the vet, which gpt-4o only suggests for humans after several days of consistant pain.\nComparative Analysis\nWhen comparing gpt-4o’s responses between human and dog medical advice, gpt-4o seems to take a more human-based approach to both, accurately caring for the human wound, but being a bit less accurate with the dog wound. Both have similar outcomes in terms of visiting a doctor in the event of lasting pain, however the human response addresses this as a last resort, whereas the dog response is more suggestive of immediate vet care, which can be expensive and completely unnecessary."
