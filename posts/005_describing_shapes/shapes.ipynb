      "* **Diameter (d):** A line segment that passes through the center and whose endpoints lie on the circle.  The diameter is twice the length of the radius (d = 2r).\n",
      "* **Circumference (C):** The distance around the circle.  It's calculated using the formula C = 2πr or C = πd, where π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.\n",
      "* **Area (A):** The region enclosed by the circle.  It's calculated using the formula A = πr².\n",
      "* **Chord:** A line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle. The diameter is the longest chord in a circle.\n",
      "* **Secant:** A line that intersects the circle at two distinct points.\n",
      "* **Tangent:** A line that intersects the circle at exactly one point, called the point of tangency.  The tangent line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.\n",
      "* **Arc:** A portion of the circumference of a circle.\n",
      "* **Sector:** A region bounded by two radii and an arc of the circle.  It's like a \"slice of pie.\"\n",
      "* **Segment:** A region bounded by a chord and an arc of the circle.\n",
      "* **Concentric Circles:** Circles that share the same center but have different radii.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "When comparing Anthropic and Gemini, their response tones appear very similar when grouping between text and image prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Prompting\n",
    "For both LLMs, the text responses for describing a circle were highly mathematical, with descriptors of applications towards identifying circles, creating circles, and using circles in relational fields such as physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I deemed this to be an accurate and highly education-based response, even teaching me some new things about the properties of a circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Prompting\n",
    "Opposingly, when presenting a standard image of a circle from Wikipedia, both LLMs took a significantly more relaxed approach. Both the text and image prompts included the words \"in as much detail as possible\", yet the text response was several paragraphs long and the image response was 2-3 sentences long. \n",
    "\n",
    "The image response included details on thickness and color, with nothing much else about the image's properties or applications, let along identification. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "It seems as though these LLMs' image identification is much less adaptive than the text response, where it seems that both LLMs were able to quickly move past the idea of a text-based circle and include highly-educated responses, yet image-based circles seemed to get stuck in the identification phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, this is highly descriptive of many of the problems seen in LLM-based image identification and creation. Text-based responses are not immune to hallucinations or inconsistencies, however it seems as though the reasoning behind text-based responses are more developed and accurate than image-based responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am curious to see if emerging new models have this same similar issue, or if this remains a problem in the base theories behind image identification and generation in LLMs. Theoretically, I believe these LLMs should be tuned to identify some base images, including a circle, so that when I present an image of a circle, it can describe thickness and colors as well as its mathematical applications.
