    "# Introduction\n",
    "Many users of OpenAIs models flaunt the idea that coding with the help of an LLM is so much easier and more efficient. For me, this is true about 50% of the time. For projects I've used LLMs to help me code, there are many times where it skips over a problem, induces a strange solution, or even sends me back the same code with no fixes! In order to test this, I'd like to see how well gpt-4o can create a fully python-based game from one prompt. I will use the classic turn-based game battleships as my example. Just for context, my CIS 1200 final project was to code battleships (without LLMs!) in Java, which never really worked..."

    "The game works really well! I was unable to find any issues with the gameplay, and the score board updating is consistent across plays. In terms of the code structure, gpt-4o seemed to organize everything very well in defined functions with controls for error messages and missing values. The comments added are descriptive but not overly so and the functions are well-named. The separation and indentations of the code are also on-par with normal code. \n",
